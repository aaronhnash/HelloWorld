# Overview

Welcome to the start of something great!

While this here is nothing more than a simple *Hello World*, this is the start of a series of projects that I will undertake. While I'm already decently familiar with Python, this serves as a reminder that every undertaking must begin from the basics.

## What does it do?
Well, much like every other *Hello World*, this program simply outputs a small phrase to the terminal, calling Python's `print` function to output the following:

```
Hello, world!
```

This software has been the start of nearly every programming-related undertaking that I've... well, undertaken. My purpose in writing it is to display familiarity and bookmark the start of a series of new projects.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
